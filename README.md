# Chocolate Bar Ratings - Python
Career Foundry Data Analytics Project in Python and Tableau

## Objective
The Manhattan Chocolate Society has rated 2500+ chocolate bars. The purpose of this project is to dig through these rankings and find key characteristics that might lead
some to create the perfect chocolate bar. My hypothesis is that Country of Bean Origin and flavor profiles play a large role in the ratings decided by our judges. 
However, I wanted to dig deeper with the columns that held numerical value to see if we could find relationships between Cacoa Percentage/Number of Ingredients with the 
ratings. 

## DATA
Open source data from The Manhattan Chocolate Society.Data Set Includes 10 columns including, Reference Number, Company (Manufacturer), Company Location, Review Date, 
Country Bean of Origin, Specific Bean Origin or Bar Name, Cacoa Percent, Ingredients, Most Memorable Characteristics, and Rating.
